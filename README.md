## Rian's Sprite Converter
This simple app is for converting grouped sprite sets (the way they might be formated for RPG Maker) into single sprite sets. Basically, one character per file. The original format may work great for RPG Maker, but for my purposes I'd rather have them separate for ease of use and improving memory management. Thus I've made this tool, and released it incase anyone else finds it useful.

## Example Usage
Basically you upload an image and this converter cuts the image in half vertically, and into quarters horizontally.

**So say you upload a sprite sheet which contains 8 different characters that looks like this:**

**The app will splice the sheet into 8 separate downloadable files like so:**

## ToDo's
- Add Download All Button to save time
- Allow multiple files to be processed at a time.
